### Questions
- How many datasets we woudl have for each city? (Average)
- What type of meta information we would have for each dataset.


## Sections

###List View

We need a clear separation for each search result.

- [Data.gov has a confusing list.](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=oil&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc)
- [Open.Canada has a much better way to separate each result](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset?q=oil)

#### List View Modes
We could have more than one way to view the result list. 

##### Condensed View
A spreadsheet-like view, with the absolute minimum of information. (Dataset name, file format, publish date, etc.) 

##### Summary View
Show casing more information for each dataset. (Name, Pub Date, Formats, summary, agency, etc.)


### Detail View
- Tags need to be shown in an organized way. [Data.gov is not good](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-oil-and-gas-assessment-database)
- Show if a dataset follows a specific standard. (ie. Open Contracting)
